# Contributor checks

Use the repository formatter and quality checks before considering TypeScript or
Next.js changes complete:

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Use `npm run format:check` in CI or when verifying a clean formatting diff.
Prettier is authoritative for formatting; ESLint supplies code-quality rules and
must not reformat code independently. Keep generated, vendor, build, and local
credential/configuration files out of formatting and lint runs.
